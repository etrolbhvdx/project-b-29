    <h1>Welcome to the UVA Arts and Sciences Transfer Site</h1>
    <h2>The rules</h2>
<p>Before submitting requests, please read <em>The Rules</em>, as outlined below:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Permission to transfer credit is not granted to students whose grade point average is less than 2.0,
        who withdrew from the College within the last ten days of the prior semester,
        who are currently under suspension, or who are on an Honor Leave of Absence.
        A 2.5 cumulative GPA is required for study abroad.
    </li>
    <li>
        Credit is allowed only for those courses in which a grade of C or better has been earned.
        Some programs may require a grade of B or better.
        Approval to take courses on a pass/fail basis must also be obtained prior to taking the courses.
        Courses in which "pass" or "credit" (CR) grades are received must be certified as equivalent to a
        grade of C or higher to be accepted.
    </li>
    <li>
        Only 60 credits of transfer from other universities, foreign study, advanced placement,
        or dual enrollment may count toward the 120 credits needed for the B.A. or B.S. degree in the College.
        Subject to these restrictions, the credits completed elsewhere with a grade of C or better
        and approved as described above will be transferred toward the degree. In the College,
        the amount of transfer credit awarded and the number of full-time semesters previously
        completed determines academic level.
    </li>
</ol>
