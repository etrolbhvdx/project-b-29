This site is used to manage transfer credit requests at UVA<br>

The site allows for students to create accounts and submit transfer requests.<br>
The student is able to search for classes that have already been approved<br>
as well as current UVA classes by a number of search methods.<br>
The student is able to view the status of all their requests in real time.<br>

The site also allows for admins to create an account.<br>
Admins create an account like a student and contacts the site to be made an admin.<br>
Admins have all the same functionality as students.<br>
Admins also have the ability to approve and deny transfer requests and give a reason for their decision.<br>
Admins can add equivalencies by submitting a request and then approving it.<br>

When requests are approved the class is added to the database of approved classes.<br>
